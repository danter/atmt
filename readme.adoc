= An Autonomous Toy Monster Truck readme

== Project overview
The goal here is to make a 'autonomous' toy-monster-truck, using my own electronic design and software for the control system. To get a head-start I used a cheap radio-controlled toy-truck as a start.

The 'brain' of the truck will be an ESP32. I'll use multiple types of sensors.

This repo will contain everything needed in this project and also try to explain the progress and results.

== Repo layout:

* doc: All documentation and images, including a full workdescription
* hw: hardware including pcb layout and all the schematics. References to used components etc
* sw: all software, not that much yet..
