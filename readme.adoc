= An Autonomous Toy Monster Truck readme

== Project overview
The goal here is to make a 'autonomous' toy-monster-truck, using my own electronic design and software for the control system. To get a head-start I used a cheap radio-controlled toy-truck as a start. In previous projects I have had some problems with the mechanics  and therefore I choosed this solution.

The 'brain' of the truck is an ESP32. I'll use multiple types of sensors.

However, it is possible to use my PCB-design or the schematics and build a sort of control-board for the motors and then have the actual control-system on an other device, such as a raspberry-pi. This might be a new project-branch in the future.

This repo will contain everything needed in this project and also try to explain the progress and eventually the results.

== Repo layout:

* doc: All documentation and images, including a full workdescription
* hw: hardware including pcb layout and all the schematics. References to used components etc
* sw: all software, not that much yet but some starters for different modules.
