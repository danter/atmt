# An Autonomous Toy Monster Truck readme

## Project overview
The goal here was to make an 'autonomous' toy-monster-truck, using my own electronic design and software for the control system. To get a head-start I used a cheap radio-controlled toy-truck as a start and replaced the radio-control with my own PCB.

The 'brain' of the truck is an ESP32 and the sensors used are ultrasonic distance-sensors and a acc/gyro/compass.

This repo is now updated and will be used as a start for the 'Neard-Team' at ScaniaHack May 16th and 17th.

### Other uses:
However, it is possible to use my PCB-design or the schematics and build a sort of control-board for the motors and then have the actual control-system on an other device, such as a raspberry-pi.

Each distance sensor uses 2 ios from the ESP32 and these can of course be used by other sensors as well but pay attention to the power-supply for these since they use 4.5V directly from the batteries.

This repo will contain everything needed in this project and also try to explain the progress and eventually the results.

## Repo layout:

* doc: Documentation and images, 
** A workdescription for the conversion
** A proposal for how to setup the work at ScaniaHack
* hw: hardware including:
** PCB layout and all the schematics. 
** References to used components etc. 
** CAD models and 3d printables for some add-ons to the chassi.
* sw: all software, not that much yet but some starters:
** testprogram to run all sensors and controls (basically to test that the hardware works as intended)
** A template for using OTA
